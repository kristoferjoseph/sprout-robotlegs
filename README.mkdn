# Project Sprouts Robotlegs Gem _*Pre-Alpha_

This RubyGem contains templates and libraries for developing [Robotlegs](http://www.robotlegs.org/) based MVCS DI applications in Actionscript 3.0 and Flex 4.0  

>**WARNING** This is opinionated software. 
This is not and will never be infinitely configurable. Care was taken to allow customization where needed, but it is made and tested to 	work the way I think it should. Please fork and add whatever features you feel are missing.
